    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "______________________________________________________________________________________________TEXT, INTEGER, REAL, BLOB. For example; Date, Time, Datetime can be count as other common types.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "______________________________________________________________________________________________The primary key consists of one or more columns whose data contained within is used to uniquely identify each row in the table. A foreign key is a set of one or more columns in a table that refers to the primary key in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "______________________________________________________________________________________________There are 3 types of relationships in entities can have in a SQL database. They are:One-to-One, One-to-Many (or Many-to-One),Many-to-Many.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "______________________________________________________________________________________________There are four basic types of SQL joins: inner, left, right, and full.Inner Join gets all records that match the condition in both tables, and records in both tables that do not match are not reported. Left Join returns all the rows from the left table in conjunction with the matching rows from the right table. Right Join returns all the rows from the right table in conjunction with the matching rows from the left table. Outter Join combines left join and right join. It returns rows from either table when the conditions are met and returns NULL value when there is no match.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "______________________________________________________________________________________________The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like \"find the number of customers in each country\".The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) to group the result-set by one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "______________________________________________________________________________________________A join table creates two one-to-many relationshipsâ€”one between each of the two tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
